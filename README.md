# News App
## Overview
Welcome to the News App!This application is designed to provide a streamlined and efficient way to stay updated with the latest news. Whether you're interested in breaking news, want to save articles for later, or need to search for specific topics, this app has you covered. Developed with modern Android development practices, this app combines functionality with a user-friendly interface to enhance your news consumption experience.
## Features
### Breaking News
The app starts with the Breaking News fragment, where users can access the most current headlines from various sources. Articles are presented in a clean and readable format within a WebView. Users can easily click on any article to view the full content and save articles that interest them for future reference.
### Saved News
In the Saved News fragment, users can view and manage their saved articles. The app includes intuitive swipe-to-delete functionality for managing saved items. If you accidentally delete an article, the Snackbar notification allows you to undo the action, ensuring that important articles are not lost inadvertently.

### Search News
The Search News fragment enables users to search for news articles on specific topics. By entering relevant keywords into the search bar, users can quickly find articles that match their interests, making it easy to keep track of specific news topics and stay informed.
## Architecture
This app is built using a robust architecture and set of technologies that ensure maintainability, scalability, and a high-quality user experience:

### -MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):
This architectural pattern separates the UI from the business logic, making the app easier to manage and test. The ViewModel handles data and business logic, while the View updates the UI based on the data provided by the ViewModel.

### -Clean Architecture: 
Adopting Clean Architecture principles helps in creating a well-structured codebase. It divides the application into distinct layers, each with its own responsibility, which enhances modularity and makes the code more maintainable and testable.

### -Retrofit: 
Retrofit is used for network operations and API calls. It simplifies the process of retrieving and parsing JSON data from web services, making it easier to integrate news data into the app.

### -Glide:
Glide is employed to efficiently load and cache images within the app. It handles image loading smoothly and helps in reducing the load times for images, ensuring a faster and more responsive user experience.

### -Navigation Component:
The Navigation Component manages the navigation between different fragments in the app. It provides a consistent and predictable navigation experience, helping users move seamlessly between breaking news, saved news, and search results.

### -Room:
Room is used for local data storage. It allows users to save articles offline and manage their saved articles efficiently. Room provides a robust database abstraction layer that simplifies data management.

### -Coroutines: 
Kotlin Coroutines are used for handling background tasks and asynchronous operations. They allow for smoother and more efficient data processing and UI updates without blocking the main thread.
